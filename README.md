# Assignment 0-b Flex

This is a project to help you understand how to use nested flex box containers.

It looks like this when complete

## How to consume this project?

Consume this as you did `https://github.com/CodersCampus/Assignment0Template` by clicking green template button, creating a repository on your github account, and then cloning down to your local box.

Then run it on your box. You don't need to push it back up to your github account, though you could if you wanted to!

## What to look for

1. Look for the flex containers nested inside the flex containers!!!
2. Look how this page resizes itself. You don't need margins or padding or ...
3. Experiment with it in dev tools, especially hovering over different parts of the page while in the inspect mode.

Hopefully you will have this ahah: `Ahah! I could use nothing but flex containers inside flex containers to control where everything on my page is!`

## WUT??? I could create this myself?
